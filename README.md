# Capstone Progress

## Progress Report for Sept 6th Deadline
I have begun solidifying my idea to have my mother as the center of my piece. I am aiming to collect stories from her life in her own words as well as expressions of herself in mediums she feels comfortable with. After collecting this data, I will have more clarity on the specific direction of the piece. So far, I have a recording of her singing her favourite gospel song that she describes as being a succinct representation of what her life has looked like over the years. This recording can be found here: [Mom Gospel Song.zip](https://github.com/Alphaam/Capstone/files/9485522/Mom.Gospel.Song.zip)
