# Capstone Progress

## Progress Report for Sept 6th Deadline
I have begun solidifying my idea to have my mother as the center of my piece. I am aiming to collect stories from her life in her own words as well as expressions of herself in mediums she feels comfortable with. After collecting this data, I will have more clarity on the specific direction of the piece. So far, I have a recording of her singing her favourite gospel song that she describes as being a succinct representation of what her life has looked like over the years. This recording can be found here: [Mom Gospel Song.zip](https://github.com/Alphaam/Capstone/files/9485522/Mom.Gospel.Song.zip)



## Progress Report for Sept 13th Deadline
This week I gave myself two action items. First, I planned to figure out how to actually create an AR piece in the least time-consuming way I could find while not compromising my projects quality. Second, I planned on figuring out how to input my own voice into a project that is very much not about me. 

For the first task, I reached out to Waad, an IM major from the class of 2021, who had a brief element of AR in her IM capstone. From her, I learned of the software, “Artivive.” Artvive allows a user to augment a physical space by simply taking a picture of the space and uploading onto the software the content that the user wishes to have displayed on this physical space when viewed through the Artivive app. I experimented a bit with this and was able to figure out how to do this in a way that felt satisfactory to me. A video of me figuring this out can be found here:

The concerns I have about this technology are the fact that the projected content seems a little wobbly and I would like it to be more stabilized. I plan on experimenting with printing out the target image to be projected on as opposed to using an actual physical object as the subject of projection by the AR technology. This is reported to help with stabilization.

The process of finding my own voice within the piece is on-going, but so far I was able to take a bit of that space by blocking out the content I had collected from my mother and beginning animation based on colours and imagery that appealed to me while still taking into account the ultimate feel of the piece as I know it now. When I engaged in this exercise, I was able to come up with a colour palette that I really love, find brushes that I like, and a poetic interpretation of the story I want to tell that felt true to how I approach understanding a story. A preliminary sketch of the first shot of the animation can be seen here:

The next steps of my process are figuring out where my project will live. Will it be an installation? Of what scale? Do I want to include light in the piece as a way to further whatever story I will tell? Which one of the many stories that I collected from my mother will be the primary story? 

To answer some of these questions, I am planning on visiting the new exhibit on campus in the gallery space facing the road off campus.

## Progress Report for September 20th

This week I focused on two things:
1.	Finding inspiration for what the installation space for my project will look like
2.	Continuing to research AR to find which execution of the technology is best suited for my research

1. In researching the look of my installation, I found that I am very, aesthetically, drawn to installations that incorporated ceiling to floor-length flowing textures. Examples of these installations are as seen below:

I think that this structure of an installation works very well with the kind of animation that I am going to make. Seeing as my animation is going to be a story happening outdoors mainly with an enchanted forest feel, the flowing sheets aid to the aesthetics of the animation quite well. My current idea is having the animation that I make live on these sheets with the story spilling into the sheets next to each other in a way that takes the participant throughout the room following the story on their AR visualization device. I am going to experiment with this structure at a smaller scale in this coming week and see how attainable it is.

Another structure in installations that I am very drawn to is holograms and other display items in glass/glass-like containers. Examples can be seen below:

I imagine that having structures like these looping through certain bits of the animation could aid to the overall aesthetic of the space but I am unsure if it lends itself to the ultimate story of the installation in a way that necessitates them being in the installation. I will continue to sit with this data and see if that changes.

2. I committed some time to learning Unity over the past week. My initial impression is that it might be a bit more complicated than I will need for this specific project as the primary things I wish to spend time creating are 2D animations and sound. I will continue to spend time learning Unity while I also continue to look at other simpler options before I make a final decision about the software I will use.
