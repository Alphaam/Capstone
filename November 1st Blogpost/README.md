### Question

I recognize that we should view our lack of specialization in IM as a strength because the employment world is looking for generalists with a desire to learn. However, what are the caveats to this? is the fact that I know a little about a little bit of everything an actual practical advantage over someone who has in-depth specific experience for a role?

I am fairly convinced I want to do projection mapping for my capstone. The biggest technological hurdle I anticipate is syncing the multiple projectors. This is especially important since I plan on having my animation have a progression between projectors (have a character walk from one wall into another in the installation room for example). I, therefore decided to figure this out first.

I got two laser projectors from the IM lab. The first challenge was how to connect both projectors to the same device (my computer). After a bit of fiddling with adaptors, I was able to figure out how to get this done. I just had to use two separate ports on my computer for each projector. It did not work when both projectors were connected from the same port.

After I connected both projectors, I then had to figure out how to get each projector to project something different simultaneously. After a bit of googling, I found a solution through the “System Preferences” settings on my Mac. I was finally able to project two separate things using the same device.

The next step in this process was to figure out how to create an animation that would flow well between two projectors. I created a mock animation of a pointing finger moving across the screen. My instinct was to copy this animation and add empty frames into the animation that were the same number of frames as the filled frames. The thought process was that if I played both animations at once on the separate projectors, one animation would start playing while the other would delay for the exact number of frames as the animation that was already playing. However, when I tested this out, it simply did not work. The delay in the second animation was too long and the piece did not look like one animation bleeding into another continuously. 

I then decide to reduce the number of empty frames in the second animation. This seemed to work but the longer the animations looped the more there was a gap between the animations (they did not flow continuously).

I then realized that both my animations need to have the exact same length if I wanted the gap to not develop and that I just needed to play the second animation a few seconds after the first animation. Once I did this, the animation worked perfectly.
